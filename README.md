This is a tiny, simple Reddit clone done in ASP.NET MVC 4 (using Web API) on the backend, and AngularJS, jQuery and Bootstrap on the front end.  
  
This app was written for the [July 2012 BoulderJS meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-JS/events/72089132/). It is *very* simple and not production quality at all. Many shortcuts were taken to get the backend up, security was not a consideration, and no tests have been written. It's really unlikely this will ever be more than a simple demo app.

# Goals

A tiny subset of Reddit is the goal:
* submit links
* vote up/down links
* comment on links
* view a user's profile
* very primitive ranking algorithm for comments/links (just sorting by overall vote count)

So far I am using Bootstrap so the app has a Bootstrap look to it, but if I have time I think I'll make it look like Reddit too.

# Users

There are two canned users, they are:

* username: Alexis, password: password
* username: Steve, password: password
